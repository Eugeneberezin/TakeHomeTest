Test automation assignment. 




Unzip the zip file that you’ve received from your recruiter. You will find a folder “PKUITestAutomation”
Open that folder and run “PKUITestAutomation.xcodepro”
Please answer CI/CD questions. 
As you finished, submit your project with the answers to CI/CD questions. 

Scope of the test assignment: 
Swift and XCUITest is HIGHLY preferred!  If you worked with Appium try to do some investigation on XCUITest and implement the UI test in Swift and XCUITest. 

The code source does not have a UI Test target, you would need to add it yourself if you choose to implement it in Swift and XCUITest. 

You will need to write a UI test automation for this app. 
You must cover all the screens.
The app does not have a backend so any credentials would work for email and password text fields.

Please implement a UI test in a design pattern/framework that you prefer (Page Object Model, Cucumber, etc.)

On the settings screen Select Photo buttons will prompt you to the photo library. Try to figure out how to automate this scenario. However, if you get stuck on those elements, don’t worry and try to move on. 

You must cover in your tests all of the text fields and sliders.
